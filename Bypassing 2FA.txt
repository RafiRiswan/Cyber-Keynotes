Bypassing 2FA
• 2FA adds additional check before loggin in, like sms, authenticator...etc
• Response manipulation
	• Give some dummy code and try to work on the response I
	• Try to change the response to some true representing term
	• Or give a valid code and capture the response and then use the same response for invalid code
	• Just keep on testing
	• Response manipulation works most of the time.

• Status code manipulation
	• As the name suggests sometime after giving an invalid code we get reponse with response code 4xx
	• Change it to something like 2xx, and see if it works

• Code leakage in response, thoroughly check the response as sometimes it may reveal the valid code.

• JS file analysis
	• JS file relevant to server may contain logic/leaks regarding the code.

• Exploiting No-rate limit on the 2fa accepting code(Bruteforce)
• Able to use User-A's code for User-B
• CSRF on 2FA disabling, as the name CSRF suggests here there wont be any protecting for disabling 2FA
• Social engineering to disable 2FA
• By trying some null codes
• 2FA always have some feature called backup-codes, we can abuse it's funtionality using the above mentioned techniques.
